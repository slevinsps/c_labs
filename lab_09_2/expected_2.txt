Amy 
normally hated Monday 
mornings. but this year was different.       
Kamal was in her art class 
and she liked Kamal. She was waiting 
outside the classroom when her friend 
Tara arrived.
 Hi Amy! Your mum sent me a text. 
You forgot your inhaler. 
Amy don t you turn your phone on? 
 Amy didn t like technology. 
She never sent text messages and 
she hated Facebook too.
 Did Kamal ask you to the disco?  
Tara was Amy s best friend, 
and she wanted to know everything 
that was happening in Amy s life.
